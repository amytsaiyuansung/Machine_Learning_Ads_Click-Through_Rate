# Machine_Learning_Ads_Click-Through_Rate
This project aims to predict click-through rate for online advertising by applying machine learning classification algorithms.
30M+ rows train dataset is splitted into 31 small training data files, each with around 1M rows. 
Test data is another file with 13M+ rows of data. 

Percentage of clicks is around 17% in the train data. 
Classification techniques such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and neural network are applied. 
One-hot encoding, label encoding and feature engineering are applied with 20+ categorical variables.

The final prediction utilizes an emsemble method that uses the prediction results of several random forests with different train data. The final prediction obtains a log loss of 0.41.
